# Light Chaser

![Gameplay screenshot](https://github.com/GhostatSpirit/GlobalGameJam17/raw/master/Docs/screenshot.png)

A top-down 2-player shoot games where two aliens shoot light waves to explore the scene and try to execute each other. Requires two Xbox 360 controllers to play.

Light is a wave, so it could bounce off the walls. Yet it could only bounce 5 times because some energy is absorbed in each bounce. Of course, you could also use light to illuminate the scene and get a better view. The light waves could also darken your enemy's view because she could not see light of that frequency!

May the light enlighten you and darken all your enemies.
